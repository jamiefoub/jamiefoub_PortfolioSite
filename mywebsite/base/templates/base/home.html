                <p class="para-main">
                    I completed my 4th year individual project on the “DESIGN OF A CROSS DIE FOR SHEET METAL FORMING PROCESS”. In which I applied my Solid Works knowledge to produce CAD models and accompanying component drawings of the complete die design. 
                    I was also required to learn and implement new skills in Abaqus FEA software to compute simulation testing of the cross die. I achieved an “A” grade for this work. 
                </p>

                <h5 class="titles">Project Summary</h5>
                <p class="para-main">
                    When working with sheet metal it is critical that the engineer has a good representation of the formability limits of a given material. This can be achieved using a materials Forming Limit Curve (FLC). 
                    This is an essential tool for the engineer when designing sheet metal parts.
                </p>
                    
                <p class="para-main">
                    Currently the two most popular testing methods for producing a materials FLC are the Nakazima and Marciniak tests. Though these testing methods prove to be very popular and effective ways in producing the FLC, they do have some drawbacks. 
                </p>
                    
                <p class="para-main">
                    These testing methods require multiple tests to be carried out with material samples of varying sizes and geometries. This is required to account for the full range of the failure modes of the FLC. 
                    This proves to be very time consuming and expensive due to materials waste and iterative testing that is required.
                </p>

                <p class="para-main">
                    The Solution to these problems could be solved through the use of cross-die testing. The cross-die testing method is capable of comprising a broad range of stress-strain states. 
                    This effectively allows the cross-die in a single test to achieve the same amount of data as several iterations of the Nakazima and Marciniak tests. Significantly cutting down on material waste, cost and testing time.

                    <p class="para-main"> For my 5th year group project, we were tasked with designing a fire and blast wall to separate modules on a new 
                        build FPSO, whilst optimising for a low cost and low weight design. This would provide protection between 
                        modules in the event of an explosion and accompanying jet fire.

                    <p class="para-main"> My main contributions to the group were developing design optimisation code using MATLAB as well as producing 
                        the groups CAD models and drawings using Solid Works. I also carrying out the finite element analysis of the groups
