                    <p class="para-main"> I have recently graduated from the University of Aberdeen with a master’s degree in mechanical engineering, achieving a 2:1 classification. 
                        During this time I have carried out two big projects as well as studying the prescribed courses, those being my 4th year individual project and 5th year group project.

                <p class="para-main">
                    I completed my 4th year individual project on the “DESIGN OF A CROSS DIE FOR SHEET METAL FORMING PROCESS”. 
                    In which I applied my Solid Works knowledge to produce CAD models of the complete DIE design as well as accompanying Solid Works component drawings. 
                    I was also required to learn and implement new skills in Abaqus FEA software to compute simulation testing of the DIE. I was graded an “A” for this work.

                <h5 class="titles">Abstract</h5>
                <p class="para-main">
                    Metal forming is the process of taking material that has already been simply formed from a shaping operation such as casting, melt extrusion or die casting and further forming it through plastic deformation into a more desired end shape. 
                    This end shape could be the final shape of the metal or to make it better for following processes, making it suitable for machining, metal treatment, joining, etc.
                </p>
                    
                <p class="para-main">
                    There are many types of metal forming from curling, bending, punching and hydroforming for instance. 
                    To apply these sheet metal forming techniques effectively it is important to understand how these forming techniques will affect the material being worked.
                </p>
                    
                <p class="para-main">
                    To get an idea of the limitations of the material and how it will perform, a number of simulations and experimental techniques can be used. 
                    However, these methods can prove to be quite expensive and rather time consuming. A more effective solution would be to design a cross-die. 
                    This thesis explores and proposes a design of a cross-die that will be used within the sheet metal forming process.

                    <p class="para-main"> For my 5th year group project, we were tasked with designing a fire and blast wall to separate modules on a new

                        modules in the event of an explosion and accompanying jet fire.
