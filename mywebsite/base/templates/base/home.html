                    <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio website! Here I aim to build this site out to show case some of my work I have completed whilest studying at university, aswell as some projects I have done in my spare time.</p>

                    <p>I have completed my Masters Degree in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Aberdeen, achieving a 2:1 classification. Now actively seeking engineering work at graduate/junior level.</p>

                    <p>My key Skills: Solid Works CAD, ABAQUS FEA, MATLAB and Python</p>

                    <h5>My Experience and Education</h5>
                    <hr>
                    <p>I have recently graduated from the University of Aberdeen with a master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering. During this time I have carried out two big projects, those being my 4th year individual project and 5th year group project.</p>
                    
                    <p>I completed my 4th year individual project on the “DESIGN OF A CROSS DIE FOR SHEET METAL FORMING PROCESS”. In which I applied my Solid Works knowledge to produce CAD models of the complete DIE design as well as accompanying Solid Works component drawings. I was also required to learn and implement new skills in Abaqus FEA software to compute simulation testing of the DIE. I was graded an “A” for this work. </p>
                    
                    <p>For my 5th year group project, we were tasked with designing a fire and blast wall to separate modules on a new build FPSO, whilst optimising for a low cost and low weight design. This would provide protection between modules in the event of an explosion and accompanying jet fire.</p>

                    <h5>What I Know</h5>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Over my time at university I have become used to many software packages, those being Solid Works, ABAQUS and MATLAB to name a few.</p>
                    <p>Though in my spare time I like to build on my software development skills. In doing so I have a knowledge of python.</p>
